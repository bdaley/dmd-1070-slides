# Flexbox
a.k.a., The Flexible Box Module 

# What is Flexbox?

CSS Flex Box Layout is a CSS3 web layout model. It is in the W3C's Candidate Recommendation (CR) stage. The flex layout allows responsive elements within a container to be automatically arranged depending upon screen size (or device). -- Wikipedia

Flex Box is a new-ish layout mode, on top of the existing modes:

* Block
* Inline
* Table	
* Positioned


# Flex Containers can...

* be laid out in any flow direction (leftwards, rightwards, downwards, or even upwards!)
* have their display order reversed or rearranged at the style layer (i.e., visual order can be independent of source and speech order)
* be laid out linearly along a single (main) axis or wrapped into multiple lines along a secondary (cross) axis
* “flex” their sizes to respond to the available space
* be aligned with respect to their container or each other on the secondary (cross)
* be dynamically collapsed or uncollapsed along the main axis while preserving the container’s cross size


# HTML Test

```html
<section class="something">
    something
</section>



```
